## üöÄ Next Steps for Matching Engine

### 1. Add Support for IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel) Orders

Behavior: Execute immediately whatever possible, cancel any unfilled quantity (do not place on book).

Why: This is a widely used order type for fast execution without leftover orders clogging the book.

How: When an IOC order is placed, match immediately. If any qty remains, discard it instead of placing it on the book.

### 2. Add Support for FOK (Fill-Or-Kill) Orders

Behavior: Either fully fill the order immediately or cancel it completely.

Why: Useful for large traders wanting ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù fills.

How: Before matching, check if the order can be fully filled against the current book. If yes, match fully. If no, cancel immediately.

### 3. Support Market Orders

If you haven‚Äôt implemented market orders yet, now is the time:

Behavior: Match immediately at best available prices, no price limit.

Notes: Market orders never go on the book.

### 4. Implement Order Cancellation

Allow users to cancel their resting orders from the book.

Handle partial cancels and full cancels safely.

### 5. Add Stop Orders (If You Want Triggered Orders)

Behavior: The order sits inactive until a specified stop price triggers it.

You‚Äôll need a price watcher to activate these orders when the market hits the trigger price.

### 6. Add Order Expiry or Time-in-Force Flags

Time-in-Force options like Good-Till-Canceled (GTC), Day Orders, or Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC).

Let orders auto-expire or cancel based on these settings.

### 7. Add More Complex Conditions or Order Types (Optional)

All-Or-None (AON): Fill only if the whole order quantity can be matched.

Trailing Stops: Stop price adjusts with market price.

One-Cancels-Other (OCO): Pair of orders where filling one cancels the other.

### 8. Improve Matching Logic and Performance

Optimize data structures for faster matching (e.g., order books by price levels).

Handle concurrency safely if you expect parallel order submissions.

### 9. Add Logging and Audit Trail

Record every order event: submission, match, partial fill, cancellation.

Useful for debugging and regulatory compliance.

### 10. Build a Simple API / Interface

    Expose your matching engine via REST or WebSocket.

Let clients submit orders, query the order book, get trade notifications.
